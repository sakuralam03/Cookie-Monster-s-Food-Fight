AnonymousDoc AI is a privacy-first document processing webapp that uses intelligent redaction to protect sensitive information in PDFs, contracts, and reports—without breaking context or usability. Users simply upload a document, and our AI scans it for personally identifiable information, legal risk markers, and metadata leaks. It then applies smart anonymization and assigns a proprietary Cookie Score—a transparency metric that quantifies how well the document preserves utility while minimizing exposure.

Whether you're handling NDAs, medical records, or internal reports, AnonymousDoc AI ensures your documents stay useful, shareable, and safe.
