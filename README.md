# Project description

## Background
According to DQ Institute's Child Online Safety Index, about two-thirds of children from 30 countries are exposed to cyber threats.
This is a worrying trend that is projected to continue rising due to increasing ease of internet access, 
and increasing reliance on the internet in the classrooms and at home, from infants to toddlers to school-going children.

## Our project
This is a web app that aims to educate kids on online privacy through an interactive game.
We chose to focus on the cookies aspect of privacy, since not many children know about it.

## AI use
We used a simple AI text classification model that trains on JSON files containing different types of cookies.
This AI categorises a simple list of websites into 3 different coloured cookies:
- Green cookie = most likely a safe website
- Yellow cookie = this website contains suspicious cookies
- Red cookie = this website most likely
